            This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or
            seek a refund for a product/service that you have purchased through
            the Platform. Under this policy:
          </p>

          <p>
            Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within
            3 days of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not
            be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the sellers
            or merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated
            shipping, or the product is out for delivery. In such cases, you may
            choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>PAYINSIGHT</strong> does not accept cancellation requests
            for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refunds
